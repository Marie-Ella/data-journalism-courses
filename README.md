# Data Journalism University Courses and Programmes

Project for collecting details on courses and programmes dedicated to teaching data journalism from around the world – with an initial focus on universities and higher educational institutions. This is very much a work in progress. If you'd like to help out, you can [add or look at the issues](https://github.com/jwyg/data-journalism-courses/issues).
